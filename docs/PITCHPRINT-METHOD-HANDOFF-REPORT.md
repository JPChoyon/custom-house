# CustomHouse → PitchPrint authoritative method handoff

This report distinguishes local execution evidence from live production evidence.
No PitchPrint template or production-pricing database schema was changed.

## Root cause confirmed in source

1. The host answered only `CUSTOMHOUSE_PP_ORDER_CONFIG_REQUEST`; it did not answer the template's `CUSTOMHOUSE_PP_FULL_PRODUCT_CONFIG_REQUEST` or send `CUSTOMHOUSE_PP_FULL_PRODUCT_CONFIG`.
2. Public config selection treated fewer pricing entries as incomplete. A legitimate change from two enabled methods to one or zero could retain the earlier list.
3. Public launches relied on a Shopify metafield snapshot, without refreshing canonical database pricing. Creator launches could reuse previously hydrated base-product pricing.
4. An explicit empty version-two method map was incorrectly interpreted as legacy pricing and restored the old methods.
5. The public normalizer rebuilt selected fields and lost generic tier/registry metadata.

## Change

- Added an authenticated, no-store app-proxy read at `/api/pitchprint-method-config` using the existing canonical product resolver. Public launch refreshes this source and resends when it arrives; it normalizes Liquid's numeric product ID to a Shopify GID.
- Creator refreshes the existing canonical base-product endpoint on each launch. Both configs contain an array of enabled methods, including explicit `[]`, with canonical codes, currency, fee variant references, registry metadata and tier state/rates.
- Both hosts answer full-config requests and resend on existing runtime readiness events. Public retains the order-config compatibility response; Creator retains both existing compatibility responses. Requests and acknowledgements use allowed origins and remembered runtime targets.
- Pending results are keyed by product. Partial pricing cannot replace the complete method list. Authoritative reductions to one or zero methods are accepted.
- Added sanitized METHOD_HANDOFF and acknowledgement diagnostics. The existing ACK channel is observed; an ACK is not fabricated when a runtime does not emit one.

The local database environment is a placeholder and cannot establish a connection.
The unauthenticated storefront returned HTTP 401. No live DB state, iframe delivery or acknowledgement is claimed.

Validation: all 586 repository tests pass, lint passes, typecheck passes, and the production build passes. Typecheck/build used a process-local `SHOPIFY_APP_URL=http://localhost` because the saved local environment contains placeholder values. No saved environment file was changed.

Automatic approval review rejected downloading production environment variables because it retrieves sensitive credentials without specific authorization. No alternative credential extraction was attempted.

## Release requirements

App server deployment alone does not update Shopify-hosted scripts. The release must include the Creator storefront extension and the two Public theme assets:

- `extensions/customhouse-creator-storefront/assets/customhouse-dashboard.js`
- `theme-live-cart/assets/customhouse-pitchprint-order-handoff.js`
- `theme-live-cart/assets/customhouse-pitchprint-public-contract.js`

The existing Liquid already serializes `customhouse.production_method_pricing` as JSON and needs no change. The new proxy read removes reliance on metafield sync freshness.

Repository AGENTS.md requires development validation/test deployment and explicit approval before merging/deploying main. Production acceptance must be observed after all three release surfaces are deployed.
